# Ecole 42
Ã‰cole 42, founded by Xavier Niel in 2013, is an innovative, tuition-free coding school based in Paris with global campuses.\
It emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and project-based curriculum, focusing on real-world skills.\
Admission is based on potential and motivation, not academic background.\
Candidates undergo an intensive four-week selection process called "La Piscine" to demonstrate their aptitude and dedication.\
Graduates are highly sought after in the tech industry for their technical expertise and adaptability.\
The school's unique approach and commitment to accessibility make it a leader in tech education.

On this GitHub repository, all the Shell/C exercises and projects I completed during La Piscine will be available (they will be available starting in November after my entry into 42).
